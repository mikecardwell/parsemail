        Paste the raw source of an email into the form on the front page. The
        email will then be parsed, decoded, separated into its various MIME
        parts, and displayed in an easy to view fashion. Image attachments will
        be displayed as images. HTML parts will be rendered in webkit (with
        javascript and plugins disabled) and then also displayed as
        an image. IP addresses in headers and message bodies will be identified
        and highlighted along with a flag representing their origin country.
        Hostnames and email addresses will also be identified and&#160;highlighted.<br>
        <br>
        What's the point? If you run email systems for a living, you may find this
        useful as tool for quickly identifying important information in emails you
        find in your message queues and&#160;mailboxes.<br>
